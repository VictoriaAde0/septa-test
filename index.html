            The way a website works is that once we enter a search word into the browser, The browser goes to the DNS (Domain Name System) server, and finds the real address of the server that the website originates from. The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets. The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you. The web also relies on a system of hyperlinks, which are clickable elements on webpages that allow users to navigate between different web resources. These hyperlinks are typically represented as text or images and are a fundamental aspect of how users explore and interact with web content. They can connect to other webpages, websites, documents, or multimedia files, creating a vast network of interconnected information on the internet. Hyperlinks are a key element of the hypertext concept that underlies the World Wide Web.
